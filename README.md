# Touri

The City is seeking a responsive web application to deliver its archive of tour and point-of-interest (POI) content to Bloomington residents.  The application should convey text and media associated with points of interest and allow users to follow tours (typically walking tours) through the community or to view content through a desktop browser. The application should have an easy to use interface for authoring tours and POIs, and administering the application.
